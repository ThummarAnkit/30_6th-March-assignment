    "### Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Mean:__ The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all of the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and does not have any extreme values or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Median:__ The median is the middle value in a dataset, such that half of the values are above it and half are below it. The median is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has extreme values or is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Mode:__ The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency when the dataset has a high frequency of repeated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Range:__ The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure of variability when you want to describe the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Variance:__ The variance is a measure of how spread out the data is from the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance is a useful measure of variability when you want to understand how much the data varies from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Standard Deviation:__ The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a measure of how much the data varies from the mean. The standard deviation is a useful measure of variability when you want to understand how tightly clustered or spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, __measures of central tendency__ are used to describe the typical or central value of a dataset, while __measures of variability__ are used to describe the spread or dispersion of the data. The choice of measure depends on the distribution and characteristics of the data."
